# Workout-Tracker
Use this app to view, create and track daily workouts. You can log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. You would also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, you would be able to track the distance traveled.
